My real last name isn't really Kerman, it's fake and is a reference to the game Kerbal Space Program.

I know Lua, C++, and matlab but am most proficient in Java and Python.

I program as a hobby and am currently working on a private machine learning project.

I like designing good code that's easy to read and use, and find the challenge of balancing coding principles (like type safety and performance) with ease of use and understanding.
